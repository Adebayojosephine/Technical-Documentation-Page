          HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:<br>
          <code> My name is Josephine </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          That is,

          <p>
            Let's explore the paragraph element:<br>
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png">
          </p>
          <p> The main parts of our elements are as follows:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
              </li>
              <li>
                The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
              </li>
              <li>
                The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
               </li>
               <li>
                  The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
               </li>
          </ol>

            <header> Nesting Elements </header>
            <p>
               You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong">strong </a> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized

   <section"main-section" id="Images">
      <header> Images </header>
         <article>
            <p> You can add images to your website by using the'img'element, and point to a specific image's URL using the'src'attribute.
            </p>

   </section>
   
   <section class="main-section" id="Headings_and_Paragraphs">
      <header> Headings and Paragraphs </header>
      <p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements"> h1</a>-<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements">h6</a>
      </p>
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p"> p </a> elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content.
   </section>
   
<section class="main-section" id="Lists">
   <header> Lists </header>
   <p>
      A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:
      <ol>
         <li>Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a 'ul' tag element. </li>
         <li> Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an 'ol' tag element. </li>
             
   </ol>
   Each item inside the lists is put inside an  'li' tag element (list item) element.
   </p>
   </section>

<section class="main-section" id="Links">
   <header> Links </header>
   <p>
      Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element - a wrapped in a tag - "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:
      <ol>
         <li>
            Choose some text.
         </li>
           <li>
              Wrap the text in an a tag element.
         </li>
         <li>
            Give the a tag element an 'href' attribute.
         </li>
         <li>
            Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to link to.
         </li>
              
   </ol>
   NOTE:href might appear like a rather obscure choice for an attribute name at first. If you are having trouble remembering it, remember that it stands for hypertext reference.
   </p>

<section class="main-section" id="Forms">
   <header> Forms </header>
   <p>
      You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. You can do this by specifying an action attribute on your form element.
   </p>
</section>

<section clas="main-section" id="Text_Field">
   <header> Text Field </header>
   <p>
      You can create a text input by input type="text" in a tag.
   </p>
   <p>
      You can also create a placeholder by putting it in the same tag. Placeholder text is what is displayed in your input element before your user has inputted anything.
